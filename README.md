Introduction to using jQuery to manipulate items assignment<br>

1)When the DOM is ready, console.log the message “Let’s get ready to party with jQuery!”<br>
2)Give all images inside of an article tag the class of image-center (this class is defined inside of the style tag in the head).<br>
3)Remove the last paragraph in the article.<br>
4)Set the font size of the title to be a random pixel size from 0 to 100.<br>
5)Add an item to the list; it can say whatever you want.<br>
6)Scratch that; the list is silly. Empty the aside and put a paragraph in it apologizing for the list’s existence.<br>
7)When you change the numbers in the three inputs on the bottom, the background color of the body should change to match whatever the three values in the inputs are.<br>
8)Add an event listener so that when you click on the image, it is removed from the DOM.<br>
